# Chapter 1: Support Strategy & Execution

---

## Why a Support Strategy Matters

If you’re a new support manager or leader, it’s tempting to jump straight into fixing tickets and managing day-to-day chaos. But without a solid **support strategy**, your team risks burnout, inconsistent service, and missed business goals.

A support strategy is your **roadmap** — it aligns your team’s efforts with company priorities and customer expectations, giving everyone clarity and direction.

---

## Step 1: Understand Company Objectives and Customer Needs

Before you write any playbook or define an SLA, you need to **know what your company cares about** and what your customers expect.

- **Ask your leadership**: What are our company’s top priorities this quarter and year? (e.g., growth, retention, new product launches)
- **Map support impact**: How can your support team contribute? Faster response times? Better customer satisfaction? Proactive issue prevention?
- **Segment your customers**: Enterprise clients, small businesses, self-serve customers — what do they each need?

### Quick Action: Write down your company’s top 3 OKRs and brainstorm how support fits into each.

## Step 2: Define SLAs that Make Sense

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are the **promise you make to customers** about how quickly you’ll respond and resolve issues.

- **Keep SLAs realistic**: Overpromising hurts your team and frustrates customers.
- **Create tiered SLAs** based on customer segment or ticket priority:
  - Enterprise: 1-hour response, 4-hour resolution  
  - SMB: 4-hour response, 24-hour resolution  
  - Free users: 24-hour response, 72-hour resolution  
- **Document and communicate SLAs** clearly to customers and internally.

### Tip: Use data from past tickets to set SLAs you can realistically meet.

## Step 3: Build Repeatable Workflows and Playbooks

Workflows and playbooks turn your support knowledge into **repeatable processes**, ensuring consistent service no matter who’s on duty.

- Start by listing your most common ticket types (e.g., password resets, billing questions, outage reports).
- For each, create a step-by-step workflow describing:
  - How to identify the issue  
  - What to check or troubleshoot  
  - When to escalate and to whom  
  - How to communicate updates to the customer  
- Develop playbooks for critical scenarios:
  - Incident response  
  - Escalations  
  - Special requests (e.g., refunds, VIP treatment)

### Example Workflow: Password Reset  
1. Verify user identity  
2. Confirm account status  
3. Guide user through reset steps  
4. Escalate to tier 2 if unable to resolve within 10 minutes

## Step 4: Create Differentiated Support Models for Enterprise Clients

Enterprise customers often require **more personalized, hands-on support**. Here’s how to deliver that without overwhelming your team:

- Assign dedicated Technical Account Managers (TAMs) or support leads  
- Provide “white-glove” onboarding including training sessions and documentation tailored to their workflows  
- Offer faster SLA commitments or 24/7 availability  
- Regularly schedule check-ins and business reviews with enterprise stakeholders

### Pro Tip: Use enterprise feedback to prioritize product improvements.

## Step 5: Set Up Success Metrics to Track Strategy Effectiveness

How do you know your strategy is working? Choose a few key metrics to track:

- Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)  
- First Response Time (FRT)  
- Ticket Resolution Time (TTR)  
- Escalation Rate  
- Support volume trends  

Review these weekly or monthly and adjust your SLAs, workflows, or resources as needed.
