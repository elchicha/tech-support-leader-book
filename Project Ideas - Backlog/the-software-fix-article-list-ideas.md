**How to use the list**

1. **Rotate the pillars** – publish in a sequence that alternates Idealist‑heavy and Pragmatist‑heavy pieces so readers get both inspiration and immediate tools.
2. **Bundle assets** – each Pragmatist‑focused article includes a downloadable template, canvas, or calculator referenced in the title.
3. **Cross‑link** – within each post, link to the complementary Idealist article (e.g., at the end of “Build an Instant Health‑Score” link back to “The Future of Zero‑Reactive Support”).

Following this mixed‑pillar schedule will keep the newsletter fresh, reinforce your **pragmatic‑idealist** brand, and steadily build a library of actionable assets for support leaders. Happy publishing!
