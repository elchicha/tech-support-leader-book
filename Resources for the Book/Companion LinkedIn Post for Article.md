You are writing a LinkedIn post that will sit next to my newsletter article titled “[INSERT ARTICLE TITLE]”.  
Follow the exact structure of the sample post below, swapping in the facts, data, and advice from my article.

--- Sample Structure (keep the headings for guidance only) ---
1️⃣ Hook / Contrarian statement  
   “[Insert a bold, counter‑intuitive claim that challenges a common belief in the article’s topic].”

2️⃣ Contextual anchor (one recent, credible datum)  
   “[Cite a recent statistic, report, or news item that supports the claim – keep it to one short sentence].”

3️⃣ Problem amplification (why it matters)  
   “Explain briefly why this situation is painful or risky for the target audience (e.g., developers, product managers, job‑seekers).”

4️⃣ Common‑mistake illustration  
   “State the obvious thing most people do in response, then dismiss it in one clause.”

5️⃣ Authority cue (insider insight)  
   “Share a short observation of how hiring managers / senior engineers / decision‑makers actually behave, showing you know the backstage process.”

6️⃣ Single actionable tip (the “quick win”)  
   “Give ONE concrete, low‑effort action readers can take right now that directly addresses the problem.”

7️⃣ Call‑to‑Action (CTA)  
   “Wrap up with a clear next step – a link to a tool/resource, a request to comment, or an invitation to read the full article. Put the link on its own line and bold it if possible.”

--- Now fill in the blanks with the content from my article ---

Write the final LinkedIn post in a conversational tone, using short paragraphs (1‑2 sentences each) and minimal formatting (bold only for the CTA/link). Keep the total length around 150‑250 words.
