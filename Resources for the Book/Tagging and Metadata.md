**Tags** can help you track themes across chapters. You could tag notes like this:

- `#scalable-support`
- `#automation`
- `#incident-response`
- `#hiring`
- `#metrics`
    

You can also use **metadata blocks** at the top of your notes to track progress, deadlines, and priorities. For example:

---
status: draft
priority: high
deadline: 2025-12-01
chapter-type: core
tags: #scalable-support #leadership
---
